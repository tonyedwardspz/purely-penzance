		  <h2><a name="top">Cormoran, the Giant of St. Michael's Mount</a></h2>
					
		  <p class="post-info">&nbsp;</p>
				
		  <p><strong>Cormoran was the name given to the giant who is  said to have built and lived on St Michael's Mount, he was killed by  Jack the giant slayer.</strong> <br />
		    <br />
		    <img src="../images/tourism/505px-Cormoran_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_17034.jpg" alt="cormoran jack the giant killer cornwall legend" width="220" height="213" align="left" />St Michael's mount used to be known as 'The White Rock in the  Wood', it was believed that in ancient times the rock stood about six  miles from the sea and was surrounded by woodland (this may have  relevance to the Lyonnesse legend). A giant called Cormoran lived in  the area and decided to build a fortified home for himself, and to  raise it above the height of the surrounding trees so that he could see  for miles around. <br />
		    <br />
		    He was meticulous in his task and selected only the finest  white granite from the local area. These he piled high in a huge mound.  He was helped in this work by his wife Cormelian, she was not as  engaged in the toil as her husband and wondered why he was using white  granite when there was an abundance of greenstone in the area. When  Cormoran was sleeping she picked up a huge boulder of greenstone and  put it in her apron to carry, hoping to hide it in the foundations. <br />
		    <br />
		    Cormoran awoke as she was passing by, enraged at what she was  doing he leapt up and kicked her firmly in the backside, sending her  flying through the air. The greenstone dislodged from her apron and  buried itself deep into the sand, so that it could not be moved. The  stone became Cormoran's grave and is now known as Chapel Rock. <br />
		    <br />
		    In another story the giant of the mount although not named as  Cormoran, kills his wife accidentally by throwing his hammer at her. <br />

		    <span class="style2">How Cormoran was slain</span><br />
	        <img src="../images/tourism/cormeranpic.gif" alt="cormoran the giant of st michaels mount, cornwall mounts bay penwith" width="260" height="204" align="right" />From the protected  base of St Michael's Mount Cormoran terrorised the surrounding  countryside, stealing cattle and carrying them away  on his back or in his belt for a giant sized supper. </p>
		  <p>The people became so tired of the giant that they  offered an award to slay the giant. This challenge was taken up by a  farmers son called Jack who lived close to Land's End. 
		    Jack used cunning to get the giant in a vulnerable position.<br />
		    <br />
He dug a huge pit outside Morvah and covered it over with saplings and straw. When the pit  was suitably camouflaged Jack drew the giant out of the Mount by blowing his horn. <br />
<br />
The  enraged Cormoran rushed down from the Mount and before he could reach  Jack fell into the disguised pit. Jack then struck the giant with a  mortal blow with his pick and filled the pit with earth.<br />
<br />
The people of Cornwall where delighted and as a gift to his bravery he was presented with a   sword engraved with his name. Jack                           became known as Jack the giant killer, a name of legends.</p>
