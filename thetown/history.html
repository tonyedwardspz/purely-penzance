		  <p><img src="../images/thetown/DSCF2098.JPG" alt="st marys church penzance 1883" width="200" height="267" align="right" />Penzance (Cornish: Pensans) has long been in existence but  until the 17th Century it was over shadowed by Marazion, further  along the bay. Evidence of <a href="ancientmonuments.html" title="Iron Age Settlement">Iron Age settlements</a> can be found at Lescudjack Castle. Over a thousand years ago, the  chapel of St Anthony stood to the west of the towns harbour, near to the  current <a href="../community/churches.html" title="st mary's church penzance">St Mary&rsquo;s Church</a>. The only evidence of this is the carved face in a  pillar standing along side St Mary's Church. </p>  

		  <p>The first written historical  reference of Penzance as a town was in 1322,  in the manorial records, and was a place to land fish. In comparison <a href="villages/marazion.html" title="Marazion Town, Cornwall Information">Marazion</a> the now diverse neighbour was mentioned in the Doomsday booking 1088. </p>
		  <p>In the summer of 1578 Penzance was visited by the plague and records show that  10% (155) of the town&rsquo;s people were killed. The plague visited the town again  in 1647 when 217 people died.</p>
		  <p>Being at the south westerly  tip of England means that  Penzance is the first town that you come across when sailing from Europe and beyond. Over the course of history this has  led to the town and those around it to be ransacked by various nations as well as Pirates.  On July 23rd, a Spanish force led by Don Carlos de Amesquita ransacked  Mounts Bay. Amesquita forces seized suppliers  raided and burned the area before sailing away prior to confrontation with  English forces.</p>
		  <p>From the 15th to  17th century Penzance experienced  is largest growth spurt. Henry IV granted the town a royal market, Henry VIII  granted the right to charge harbour dues and James I granted it the status of a  borough. </p>
		  <p>During the English Civil  war, Penzance was sacked by Thomas Fairfax for  kindness shown to Lord Goring and Hoptons troops during the conflict.</p>
		  <p><a href="../community/publicservices.html" title="Penzance Council one stop shop">Penzance borough council</a> started major improvements to the  town starting from the 1500&rsquo;s. The market house and harbour were built during  this time. The harbour was <img src="../images/thetown/penzance harbour sunday morning 830am.JPG" alt="penzance harbour peir history" width="239" height="150" align="left" />extended in 1766 &amp; 1785. In 1759 the  construction of the reservoir allowed water pumps to be placed on public  streets.</p>
		  <p>Up until 1871, Penzance&rsquo;s religious needs had been served by the local  parish of Madron. At this time St Mary&rsquo;s church was granted parish status by  church authorities. </p>
		  <p>The <a href="harbourdevelopment_optiona.html" title="Modern Harbour developments">pier was again extended in  1812 and 1814</a> John Mathews opened a dry dock, the first in the South West. </p>

		  <p class="style1">Penzance During &amp; after the Victorian Times</p>
		  <p>The 1830&rsquo;s&nbsp; and 40&rsquo;s saw major improvements in the town.  During this time Gas street  lighting was introduced, The Market House (now Lloyds Bank) was demolished and  rebuilt. St Mary&rsquo;s Church was completed in1836 and the Roman Catholic Church in  1843. In 1930 the Egyptian House was constructed, and the first part of the  <a href="penzance_promenade.html">Promenade</a> (the only one in Cornwall)  dates from 1844.</p>
		  <p>After the passing of the  public health act in 1848, A health board was established. The first report  shows streets were either macadamised or paved, the town lit <img src="../images/thetown/penzance_train_station.JPG" alt="penzance train station 2008" width="250" height="188" align="right" />by 121 gas lamps from  October to March. Water was supplied from 6 public pumps and a further 53. At  this time waste was still being collected by carts.</p>
		  <p>The <a href="../travel/publictransport.html" title="Penzance Railway Station">Penzance railway station</a> was opened in 1852, but trains only ran to Redruth at first, but later that same  year it was extended to Truro.  The link to Plymouth (and the rest of Britain) was  not completed until 1859. At this time, passengers and goods had to change at Truro due to the tracks  being two different gages. The line was sold to Great Western Railway in 1866  and was quickly converted to standard gage. </p>
		  <p>The railway allowed local  food producers to transport their goods quickly up and down the county. Due to Penzance&rsquo;s mild climate crops were ready early, allowing  Cornish produce to demand a higher price at market.</p>
		  <p>The railway was the  beginning of mass <a href="../tourism.html" title="Tourism Information">tourism</a> for Penzance. The  towns first guide book was published in 1860 and the famous Queens Hotel was  opened the next year and expanded in 1871 and 1908. At this time Penzance was noted for it&rsquo;s pleasantness of it&rsquo;s station  and the salubrity of the air and beauty of it&rsquo;s natives.</p>
		  <p>The harbour again <a href="harbourdevelopment_optiona.html" title="Penzance harbour development">underwent  improvements</a>, Albert Pier was completed in 1858 and the light house in 1855.  Ross swing bridge was built in 1881, a large Dry Dock in 1880 and a floating  harbour with loch gates to retain water at low tide in 1884.</p>
		  <p>Public baths were opened on  the <a href="penzance_promenade.html">Promenade</a> in 1887 and <a href="publicparksgardens.html" title="Morrab Gardens penzance">Morrab gardens</a>, with its sub &ndash; tropical plants two  years later. A band stand was added in 1897.</p>
		  <p>In 1903, <a href="../travel/publictransport.html" title="Penzance Bus Timetable">public buses</a> were  introduced to the town after a failed bid to extend the train line to St Just.  The service carried 16,091 passengers in its first year, the following year  further routes were added to <a href="villages/stjust.html" title="St. Just, Cornwall">St Just</a> and Land&rsquo;s End.  The bus company later became First Devon and Cornwall Bus Network, which still  services the area.</p>
		  <p><img src="../images/thetown/jubilee_pool_penzance_prommenade.JPG" alt="jubilee pool penzance swimming baths" width="247" height="150" align="left" />Land was reclaimed by <a href="harbour.html" title="Penzance Harbour and Pier">Albert  Pier</a> in the 1930&rsquo;s to allow an extra platform for additional perishable goods  and to accommodate the thriving tourist influx during the summer months. A  <a href="../travel/cycling.html" title="penzance marazion cycle path">public cycle/footpath </a>was also constructed on this land, linking Penzance and  <a href="villages/marazion.html" title="Marazion tourist information">Marazion</a> and allowing easy access to the beaches along Mounts Bay. Jubilee pool was opened to the public in May 1935 to celebrate King George V's Silver Jubilee.</p>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
		  Great  Western Railways, The Cornish Rivera Express traveled from London  to Penzance in 1904 and took just 7 hours to  complete the journey. In 2007 the same journey takes just 5 hours to do. The  Railway Company promoted the trip via postcards and an annual guide called &lsquo;The  Cornish Riviera&rsquo;
