		  <p>If you want to explore the town, you can't do better than to follow the  Penzance Town Trail. This takes you on a circular route through the  town, tracing its story through buildings and historical remains,  rounds and medieval crosses, churches, chapels, farm towns and shops.<br />
		    <br />
		    There is a guidebook which describes the 16 way markers.
	      The  Penzance Town Trail Guidebooks are available from the <a href="touristinfo.html">Tourist  Information Centre</a>.</p>
